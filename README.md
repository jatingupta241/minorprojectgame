In this game I used random module which facilitate computer to select any random
value from 1 to 3 which will not visible earlier to the user and user will have to enter his choice i.e. r(rock), p(paper), s(scissor)
if user’s choice matches with computers then it will be a tie, otherwise as per game he will lose or win
and at last both user’s and computer’s choices will be displayed in the vs code terminal.
